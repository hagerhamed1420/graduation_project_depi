Project Description
We developed a deep learning system to generate high-quality interior design images based on text prompts.
Using Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) fine-tuned with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), we customized the model to create stylish home interiors in various designs (modern, rustic, minimalist, etc.).

The project tackles challenges like:

Fine-tuning large diffusion models under limited resources (Google Colab T4 GPU).

Applying LoRA, DreamBooth, and Custom Diffusion techniques.

Dataset preparation with automatic captioning (using BLIP2) and bilingual translation (with M2M100).
