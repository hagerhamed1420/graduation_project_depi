## 📝 Project Description

We developed a deep learning system to generate high-quality interior design images based on text prompts.

We used Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) fine-tuned with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to customize the model for creating stylish home interiors in various designs such as:
- Modern
- Rustic
- Minimalist
- And more!

This project addresses challenges like:
- Fine-tuning large diffusion models under limited resources (Google Colab T4 GPU)
- Applying LoRA, DreamBooth, and Custom Diffusion techniques
- Dataset preparation including:
  - Automatic captioning (using BLIP2)
  - Bilingual translation (using M2M100)
